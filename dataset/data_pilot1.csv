"1","2952363","I have always thought that hospitals are kind of like airports for souls - where children are born, the elderly depart, and the rest of us make unexpected but hopefully temporary trips. I thought of this analogy when my nephew Bahram was born. As I was sitting in the waiting room with my parents, it suddenly hit me how odd it was that 'five' of us had arrived at the hospital hours earlier but that 'six' of us would leave. One extra physical being coming out of no where into the hospital and our lives....","male","BLOG"

Not likely, but I have realized that despite what I may not have, that does nothing to devalue those things I have had all my life. My values, my beliefs, my principles . . . whatever you call it, I have them. I have friends, I have family, I have my physical health . . .","male","BLOG"

I got alot of work done, and after waiting for a while, got to go to the Chicago party at last. That part was great. Also, if you haven't seen it yet, you really should. But as I left to my grandparents house, where I know I don't spend enough time.","male","BLOG"

I hope it doesn't get rejected. I haven't had much time on the computer these past days, and on Thursday morning I'll be going camping for at least four days. I should be back on the computer a lot again afterwards, because I'll have nothing else to do really. I'm sick right now though, so I'm going to sleep. G'night.","female","BLOG"
"5","2324980","Dear Friends I'm tired of my opinions being tolerated. I'm tired of being told that I'm different but tolerable. And I'm shooting the next person who tells me I have 'an interesting way of viewing things.” I would rather have somebody say 'you're wrong and this is why' than 'I'm not sure if I agree but I guess your opinion makes sense from your point of view.” It's like it completely contradicts society to be 'right' or ‘wrong’… and all we have left is the grays and maybes.","male","BLOG"

Since I saw the shows I like the first time, I really only watch reruns of crime shows like Law and Order or Without a Trace. But honestly, I don’t need an excuse to watch old movies. It’s just a good reasoning -- especially since I don’t have cable. And tonight I got to watch another Van Johnson movie.","female","BLOG"

"8","2479244","I've been watching that movie 'Blue Crush' for about 15 minutes and I already hate it. No depth, no dialogue, no point. The actors are awful - every line in the movie sounded utterly scripted, and not to mention that the content of their conversations is terrible. This is just a fuel for capitalist, egotistical mindsets of our corrupted youth.","male","BLOG"
"9","2507964","The most frequently expressed complaint women have about men is that men don't listen. Either a man completely ignores her when she speaks to him, or he listens for a few beats, assesses what is bothering her, and then proudly puts on his Mr. Fix-It cap and offers her a solution to make her feel better. He is confused when she doesn't appreciate his gesture of love. No matter how many times she tells him that he's not listening, he doesn't get it and keeps doing the same thing.","male","BLOG"
