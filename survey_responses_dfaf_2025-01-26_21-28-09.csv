2: Somewhat Confident. You made a judgment but still felt uncertain or had significant doubts,,2,True,"I often come across people that react to an artist listening to, and really being into their own music, as being a vain person. Like they are so in love with themselves. However, when an artist creates music, what they are doing, is just creating exactly what they want to hear.

So, when an artist creates music, it makes perfect sense that it would be music they would really enjoy listening to.",dfaf,Mother tongue,I agree
