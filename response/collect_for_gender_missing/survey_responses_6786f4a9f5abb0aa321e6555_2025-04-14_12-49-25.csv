You felt reasonably sure of your judgment but had some doubts,,4: Somewhat Masculine,"I have always thought that hospitals are kind of like airports for souls - where children are born, the elderly depart, and the rest of us make unexpected but hopefully temporary trips. I thought of this analogy when my nephew Bahram was born. As I was sitting in the waiting room with my parents, it suddenly hit me how odd it was that 'five' of us had arrived at the hospital hours earlier but that 'six' of us would leave. One extra physical being coming out of no where into the hospital and our lives....",2952363,male,BLOG,6786f4a9f5abb0aa321e6555,,I agree,4,3

It seems no matter how many events are smashed into one day, I can never decide whether it was good or bad. Example: yesterday was pretty good. I got alot of work done, and after waiting for a while, got to go to the Chicago party at last. That part was great. Also, if you haven't seen it yet, you really should.

I'm tired of being told that I'm different but tolerable. And I'm shooting the next person who tells me I have 'an interesting way of viewing things.” I would rather have somebody say 'you're wrong and this is why' than 'I'm not sure if I agree but I guess your opinion makes sense from your point of view.” It's like it completely contradicts society to be 'right' or ‘wrong’… and all we have left is the grays and maybes.,2324980,male,BLOG,6786f4a9f5abb0aa321e6555,,I agree,4,2

Either a man completely ignores her when she speaks to him, or he listens for a few beats, assesses what is bothering her, and then proudly puts on his Mr. Fix-It cap and offers her a solution to make her feel better. He is confused when she doesn't appreciate his gesture of love.
