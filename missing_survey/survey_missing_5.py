This evaluation will focus on stylistic elements such as tone, word choice, and sentence structure rather than the content or topic of the text.

Texts included in this study are written by users on blog website and social media platforms, and may occasionally include words that could be sensitive or uncomfortable, though no extreme or offensive material is intentionally included. The texts included in this study are not authored by the researchers and do not necessarily reflect their views. </p>
